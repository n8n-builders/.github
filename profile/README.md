# n8n Builders Collective
A laid‑back community of developers building tools, plugins, and experiments for **n8n**.  
We’re here to **explore ideas independently** *and* **reduce wasted effort together**.

## 🚀 Why This Exists
> “I needed this for my own workflow.”

That’s how most great n8n plugins start — and that’s a feature, not a bug.
The problem isn’t tinkering; it’s when **multiple people unknowingly solve the same problem in parallel**, or when useful ideas never grow past a single repo.

This org gives builders a shared place to compare notes, align when it helps, and collaborate when it makes sense — without taking away the freedom to experiment.

## 🛠️ What We Build
- n8n nodes (triggers, actions, credentials)
- Experimental plugins and proofs‑of‑concept
- Shared utilities, helpers, and patterns
- Long‑term plugins *when they earn it*

Not everything here needs to be “production‑ready.”  
Some things start messy and evolve. Some stay small. That’s fine.

## 🙋 Who Should Join
You’ll feel at home here if you:
- Build or experiment with n8n plugins
- Enjoy tinkering, prototyping, and iterating
- Want visibility into what others are building
- Are open to coordination when ideas overlap

**You don’t need permission to explore.**  
Just don’t explore in a vacuum.

## 🤝 How We Think About Collaboration
1. **Start by solving *your* problem**
2. **Share early** so others can react, reuse, or extend
3. **Notice overlap** before effort is duplicated
4. **Maintain** together when a project becomes shared
5. **Lightweight decisions without heavy process**
###### Github & Discord are our main collaboration spaces.

## 🧭 Philosophy
We aim for:
- Visibility over control, alignment over approval
- Structure only when it helps scale an idea
- Exploration first, coordination when useful
- Shared vision, flexible execution
- Less duplicated work, more compounding effort

It's okay if a project stays personal. If it becomes shared, we help it grow responsibly.
